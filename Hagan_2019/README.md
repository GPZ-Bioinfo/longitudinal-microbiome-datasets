## Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans

This dataset, curated by Hagan et al., investigates the role of the gut microbiome in human immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccines. The study specifically examines how antibiotic-driven gut microbiome perturbations influence immunity in healthy adults.

### Study Design

* Participants: 22 healthy adults aged 18â€“45.

* Intervention Group: 11 participants were randomly assigned to an antibiotic intervention group, where they received broad-spectrum antibiotics for five days (from three days before vaccination to the day after vaccination).

* Control Group: 11 participants without antibiotic intervention.

* Sampling Timeline:

* Biological samples (blood and stool) were collected at the following time points:

    - 21 days prior to vaccination.
    - 3 days prior to vaccination.
    - On the day of vaccination and the day after.
    - During a follow-up period lasting up to one year.

### Key Findings:

Antibiotic-induced microbiome disturbances affected H1N1-specific IgG1 antibody responses in participants with low baseline flu immunity.
