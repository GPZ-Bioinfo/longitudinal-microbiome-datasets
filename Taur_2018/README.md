## Reconstitution of the gut microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients by autologous fecal microbiota transplant

This dataset, curated by Taur et al., evaluates the effectiveness of autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in restoring gut microbiota following antibiotic treatment in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The study focuses on the impact of gut microbiota diversity on patient outcomes and the potential of FMT to mitigate complications associated with allo-HSCT.

### Study Design

**Phase 1:**

* Participants: 753 patients undergoing allo-HSCT.

* Sampling Timeline: Stool samples were collected longitudinally over 125 days, spanning from 25 days before transplantation to 100 days post-transplantation.

* Sample Size: A total of 3,237 stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing.

**Phase 2:** A single-center randomized controlled trial involving 25 patients.

* Intervention: Fourteen patients received autologous FMT approximately 18 days post-transplantation.

* Follow-Up: Both intervention and control groups were monitored for up to one year.

* Data Collection Points: Samples were systematically collected at four critical time points: three weeks before allo-HSCT, after allo-HSCT, post-FMT, and during the one-year recovery period.


### Key Findings

Persistent exposure to antibiotics led to a significant decline in gut microbiota diversity, which failed to recover to pre-transplantation levels.
Patients with lower microbial diversity during allo-HSCT exhibited higher mortality rates.

The dynamics of gut microbiota recovery following severe perturbations.
The role of autologous FMT in microbiota reconstitution and its potential to reduce allo-HSCT-related complications.
Researchers can leverage this dataset to explore gut microbiota diversity under clinical stress, assess the efficacy of FMT interventions, and study long-term microbiome recovery patterns.
