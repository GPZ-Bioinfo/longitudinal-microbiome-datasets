## Robust variation in infant gut microbiome assembly across a spectrum of lifestyles

This dataset, curated by Olm et al., investigates the assembly process of infant gut microbiomes across diverse lifestyle contexts, with a specific focus on vertical microbial transmission between mothers and infants. The study provides a comprehensive resource for understanding lifestyle-associated microbiome development and the influence of maternal inheritance.

### Study Design

* Population:
62 healthy infants (aged 0–36 months) from the Hadza hunter-gatherer society in Tanzania.
Global meta-analysis incorporating infant microbiome data from prior studies across various countries and lifestyle contexts.

* Sampling:
16S rRNA sequencing of Hadza infant fecal samples.
Deep metagenomic sequencing of 39 Hadza infant samples paired with fecal samples from 23 mothers.

### Key Findings

**Lifestyle-Associated Microbiome Development:**

* Infant microbiomes follow distinct developmental trajectories influenced by lifestyle.

* Over 20% of genomes in Hadza infant microbiomes represent novel species, highlighting a unique microbial composition in nonindustrialized populations.

**Microbial Functional Differences:**

Industrialized infants’ microbiomes, even among breastfed individuals, lack Bifidobacterium infantis and genes involved in human milk utilization.

**Vertical Transmission:**

Shared strains within lifestyle-associated taxonomic groups between mother-infant pairs suggest vertical inheritance of lifestyle-shaped microbiomes.

**Population-Specific Insights:**

Significant compositional and functional differences between microbiomes in industrialized and nonindustrialized settings, underscoring the need to study populations beyond wealthy, industrialized nations.
