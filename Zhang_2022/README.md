## Islet autoantibody seroconversion in type-1 diabetes is associated with metagenome-assembled genomes in infant gut microbiomes

This dataset, curated by Zhang et al., explores the relationship between the gut microbiome and islet autoantibody (IA) seroconversion, a critical early indicator of Type-1 diabetes (T1D) risk. The study leverages high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to uncover microbial and functional genomic signatures associated with IA seroconversion.

### Study Design

* Population: 887 children at risk for T1D from the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) cohort.

* Sampling Period: Longitudinal sampling from 3 months to 72 months of age, with a total of 12,276 fecal samples.

* Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) Reconstruction: Samples from the same individual at different time points were pooled for analysis, yielding 21,536 MAGs.
Species Representation: MAGs covered 883 species, including 176 novel species previously uncharacterized in human microbiome studies.

### Key Findings

**Associations with IA Seroconversion:**

* 2,373 MAGs were positively associated with IA seroconversion.
* 1,549 MAGs were negatively associated with IA seroconversion.

**Functional Genomics Insights:**
* Positive Associations: Functional signatures in IA-positive MAGs include lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (Bacteroides MAGs) and sulfate reduction (Anaerostipes MAGs).

* Negative Associations: Functional signatures in IA-negative MAGs include carbohydrate degradation (lactic acid bacteria MAGs) and nitrate reduction (Escherichia MAGs).
