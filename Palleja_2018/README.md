## Recovery of gut microbiota of healthy adults following antibiotic exposure

This dataset, curated by Palleja et al., investigates the recovery of gut microbiota in healthy adults following exposure to a combination of antibiotics. The study provides a detailed, long-term view of microbiome dynamics during and after antibiotic treatment.

### Study Design

* Participants: 12 healthy Caucasian males aged 18–40 years.

* Intervention and Sampling: Participants underwent a 4-day treatment with a combination of three antibiotics: meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin.

* Stool samples were collected at five key time points:
    - D0: Before antibiotic intervention.
    - D4: Immediately after the 4-day antibiotic treatment.
    - D8, D42, D180: Recovery periods on days 8, 42, and 180, respectively.

A total of 114 stool samples were subjected to metagenomic sequencing.


### Key Findings

**Microbiota Perturbation and Recovery:**

* Following a 4-day intervention with a combination of three last-resort antibiotics (meropenem, gentamicin, vancomycin), the gut microbiota showed significant compositional changes.

* Initial effects included:

    Blooms of Pathobionts: Overgrowth of Enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum.

    Depletion of Beneficial Microbes: Reduction in Bifidobacterium species and butyrate-producing bacteria.

    Recovery to near-baseline composition occurred within 1.5 months, but 9 common species detectable before treatment remained undetectable in most subjects even after 6 months.

**Selection and Resilience of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs):**

* Antibiotic exposure selected for species harboring β-lactam resistance genes during and after treatment.

* Species with glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance genes showed:

    Increased Odds of Colonization: De novo colonization was higher in these species.

    Survival Trade-offs: Glycopeptide resistance genes reduced survival odds.

**In Vivo vs. In Vitro:**

Compositional changes observed in vivo during antibiotic intervention aligned with results from in vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests.

**Long-Lasting Effects and Resilience:**

* Although the gut microbiota demonstrated resilience, with recovery occurring relatively quickly, a mild yet persistent impact of antibiotics was detectable over the 6-month study period.

* ARG carriage was shown to modulate recovery dynamics.
